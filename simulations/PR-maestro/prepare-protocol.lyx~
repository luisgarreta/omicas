\begin_layout Standard
MD (molecular dynamics) simulation of complexes Stability of interactions
 between docked complexes of mortalin-Bcl-2 and mortalin-Bcl-xL was verified
 using 10 ns long MD simulations.
 Desmond Molecular Dynamics System [32] with OPLS all-atom force field 2005
 was used to study the dynamics of protein complexes.
 Protein–protein complexes were first prepared by protein preparation wizard
 of Maestro interface (Maestro, version 9.1, Schrödinger, LLC).
 These prepared structures were then uploaded on to Desmond set up wizard
 for MD simulations to define the boundary conditions.
 The systems were then solvated with a triclinic periodic box of TIP4P water
 molecules.
 These solvated systems were then neutralized using an appropriate number
 of counterions.
 The distances between box wall and protein complexes were set to greater
 than 10Å to avoid direct interactions with their own periodic image.
 The complexes were minimized using a maximum of 5000 steps in steepest
 descent algorithm with a gradient threshold of 25 kcal/mol/Å.
 The systems were then equilibrated with the default protocol provided in
 Desmond.
 Further MD simulations were carried out on the equilibrated systems for
 10 ns at constant temperature of 300 K and constant pressure of 101.325
 kPa (1 atm≡101.325 kPa) with a time step of 2 fs.
 During the MD simulations smooth particle-mesh Ewald method was used to
 calculate long-range electrostatic interactions.
 9 Å radius cut-off was used for Coulombic short-range interaction cut-off.
