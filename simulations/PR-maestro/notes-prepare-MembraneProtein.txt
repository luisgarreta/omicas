" Preparing membrane protein for MD in Maestro"
From: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqt4xk_yBGs
---------------------------
Protein Preparation Wizard:
---------------------------
- Import structure: 2qdz

- PREPROCESSING:
	- Sel defaults optiones, but:
		- Sel "Fill in missing side chains..."
		- Sel "Cap termini"
		- Unsel "Delete waters..."
	- Run "Preprocesing"
		- Problems found with this structure...
			- Overlapping atoms: don´t worry, these will be fixed in "Refinement"

	- Review and modify tab:
		- Run "Analyze Workspace"
			- There were no hetero groups to generate states for, continue...
	
	- Refine tab:
		- Run "Optimize..."
		- Run "Minimize..."


---------------------------
System Builder
---------------------------
- SOLVATION:
	- Set Up Membrane
		- Set "Predefined" to DPPC
		- Run "Place Automartically" to attempt to place the membrane automatically.
			- Maybe, MP could´t be places correctly because the default placement
			  takes into account the alpha helixes but no other structures.
			- So, we´ll need to select the residues manually..
				- Sel "Select" from "Place Automatically"
				- Sel "Residue" and "Residue number"
				- Add "Residue number" range (e.g. 209-554)
				- Add "Secondary structure", selecting "Strand"
				- Sel "Intersect"
				- Sel "OK" and
				- Sel "Place automatically"
			- Sel "Predefined" solvent model to "SPC"
			- Sel "Box shape" to "Orthorombic"
			- Sel "Show boundary box"
			- Not using "Custom charges" but using "Ions"

			- Sel "Ions":
				- Run "Recalculate" from "Ion placement"
				- Sel "Add salt" with defaults
				- Sel "Force field" with defaults

			- Sel "Run" to submit the job
				- Sel "Job settings"
					- Sel "Host" to "linux cluster" 
					- Sel "Save and Run"
