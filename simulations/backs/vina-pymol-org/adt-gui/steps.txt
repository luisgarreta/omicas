0. Load the protein (pdb)
1. Remove waters that they interfer with 
2. Add hydrogens --> Polar only
3. Grid --> Macromolecule --> Choose --> Select --> pdbqt 

4. Open ligand in pymol
5. Save as pdb

6. Open ligand in adt (Automatically prepare)
7. Save ligand as pdbqt: 
	- Ligand --> Output --> Save as pdbqt

8. Add protein to ligand:
	- File -> Read molecule --> select .pdbqt
