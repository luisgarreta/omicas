\begin_layout Subsection
Simulation Systems [Tyagi2021]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A model of the full-length Bcl-xL protein in a membrane-anchored configuration
 was constructed by combining two solution NMR structures: one lacking the
 C-terminal helix (PDB ID: 1LXL; residues 1–222) [29] and another of the
 isolated C-terminal helix (PDB ID: 6F46; helix α8, residues 209–231) [30].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After aligning the C-terminal helix along the Cartesian z-axis, the two
 structures were superimposed and joined at residue Gln-207 to generate
 a model for the membrane anchored full-length Bcl-xL, where the C-terminal
 helix is in a transmembrane orientation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each simulation, Bcl-xL was anchored into the membrane by embedding
 the C-terminal helix in the lipid bilayer such that the Trp-213 residue
 was just below the lipid phosphate groups and the soluble folded domain
 was within 4 Å of the membrane surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The membrane-anchored Bcl-xL model was incorporated into four different
 simulation systems, each with one of two protein protonation states to
 which all Bcl-xL acidic and histidine residue sidechains were protonated
 or unprotonated (hereafter identified as protonated or deprotonated configurati
ons, respectively); and one of two membrane compositions: 100% 1-palmitoyl-2-ole
oyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) or POPC at a 2:1 ratio with 1,1,2,2,-tetr
aoleoyl-cardiolipin (2POPC:1TOCL).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The simulation system setup was performed with CHARMM-GUI [31–37].
 All simulations are summarized in Table 1.

For the unprotonated 100% POPC simulation, Bcl-xL was embedded in a lipid
 bilayer consisting of 411 POPC, both solvated with 36,055 water molecules
 and neutralized with 50 mM excess NaCl (43 Na + , 32 Cl − ), for a total
 of 166,907 atoms and an initial simulation cell size of 129.9 Å × 129.3 Å
 × 124.8 Å.

\begin_layout Itemize
For the protonated 100% POPC simulation, Bcl-xL was embedded in a lipid
 bilayer consisting of 412 POPC, both solvated with 36,094 water molecules
 and neutralized, and with 50 mM excess NaCl (32 Na+ , 56 Cl−), for a total
 of 167,206 atoms and an initial simulation cell size of 130.0 Å × 128.1 Å
 × 125.0 Å.

\begin_layout Itemize
Similarly, for the unprotonated 2:1 POPC:TOCL simulation, Bcl-xL was embedded
 in a lipid bilayer consisting of 239 POPC and 120 TOCL, both solvated with
 46,584 water molecules and neutralizing Na+ (131 Na+ ), for a total of
 205,383 atoms and an initial simulation cell size of 151.1 Å × 143.3 Å ×
 129.4 Å.

For the protonated 2:1 POPC:TOCL simulation, Bcl-xL was embedded in a lipid
 bilayer consisting of 239 POPC and 120 TOCL, both solvated with 46,586
