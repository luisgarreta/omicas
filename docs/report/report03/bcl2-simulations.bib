abstract = {The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL regulates apoptosis by preventing the permeation of the mitochondrial outer membrane by pro-apoptotic pore-forming proteins, which release apoptotic factors into the cytosol that ultimately lead to cell death. Two different membrane-integrated Bcl-xL constructs have been identified: a membrane-anchored and a membrane-inserted conformation. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of the mitochondrial specific lipid cardiolipin and the protein protonation state on the conformational dynamics of membrane-anchored Bcl-xL. The analysis reveals that the protonation state of the protein and cardiolipin content of the membrane modulate the orientation of the soluble head region (helices $\alpha$1 through $\alpha$7) and hence the exposure of its BH3-binding groove, which is required for its interaction with pro-apoptotic proteins.},

@article{Mushtaq2021,
abstract = {B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins are the main regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins possess a hydrophobic tail-anchor enabling them to translocate to their target membrane and to shift into an active conformation where they inhibit pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to ensure cell survival. To address the unknown molecular basis of their cell-protecting functionality, we used intact human Bcl-2 protein natively residing at the mitochondrial outer membrane and applied neutron reflectometry and NMR spectroscopy. Here we show that the active full-length protein is entirely buried into its target membrane except for the regulatory flexible loop domain (FLD), which stretches into the aqueous exterior. The membrane location of Bcl-2 and its conformational state seems to be important for its cell-protecting activity, often infamously upregulated in cancers. Most likely, this situation enables the Bcl-2 protein to sequester pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins at the membrane level while sensing cytosolic regulative signals via its FLD region.},
